# How We Tricked ncurses Into Running Without a Terminal (And Got Test Coverage)

**Or: Yes, You CAN Emulate a TTY in 2025 – Here's How**

## The Problem: Tests That Demand a Real Terminal

We were porting MCL (a MUD client from the early 2000s) from C++ to Rust, and hit a classic problem: some tests refuse to run in CI/CD environments.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_init_curses() {
    if !has_tty() {
        eprintln!("SKIP: requires a TTY (run from a real terminal)");
        return;
    }
    // Test ncurses initialization...
}
```

The issue? Our ncurses FFI code needed `isatty()` to return `true`, but:
- CI runners don't have TTYs
- Coverage tools run tests without terminals
- Our coverage for `curses.rs` was stuck at **18.56%**

Three curses tests always skipped. Coverage tools never saw that code path.

## First Attempt: The `script` Command

"It's 2025," we thought. "Surely we can emulate a TTY?"

On macOS/Linux, the `script` command creates a pseudo-TTY:

```bash
env TERM=xterm-256color script -q /dev/null \
  cargo test --lib curses:: -- --test-threads=1
```

**Result:** ✅ Tests passed!

```
running 3 tests
ACS_VLINE: 0x78
ACS_HLINE: 0x71
test curses::tests::test_get_acs_codes ... ok
```

Victory! The tests ran! ncurses initialized! We got real ACS line-drawing codes!

## The Coverage Problem

But when we tried to get coverage metrics:

```bash
env TERM=xterm-256color script -q /dev/null \
  cargo llvm-cov --summary-only -- --test-threads=1
```

**Coverage for curses.rs:** Still 18.56% 😢

The tests **ran** and **passed**, but coverage didn't budge. Why?

### Why `script` Breaks Coverage

1. **Process isolation**: `script` forks, creating a child process
2. **Coverage data lives in child**: llvm-cov profiling counters don't cross process boundaries
3. **Parent never sees execution**: The parent process (running llvm-cov) never sees the code that executed in the child

The pseudo-TTY gave us `isatty() == true`, but at the cost of breaking coverage instrumentation.

## The "Idle Thought"

After documenting this limitation in our `TESTING.md`, we had a conversation:

> **User:** "Could we somehow write a version of `script` that doesn't have this limitation for llvm-cov, somehow passes the necessary data through some kind of side channel?"
>
> **Claude:** "That's a brilliant idle thought! Let me think through it... Actually, the simplest solution is probably LD_PRELOAD to mock `isatty()`..."
>
> **User:** "Well, good thing I'm not the one doing it! Give it a shot while I'm on my break ;)"

Challenge accepted.

## The Solution: DYLD_INTERPOSE

### Why Not Just LD_PRELOAD?

On Linux, you'd use `LD_PRELOAD` to override `isatty()`:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=./faketty.so cargo test
```

But on **macOS**, `LD_PRELOAD` doesn't exist. macOS uses `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, but simple function replacement doesn't work due to symbol precedence.

The solution? **`DYLD_INTERPOSE`** – macOS's built-in mechanism for function interposition.

### Building the Shim

Here's the core of `faketty.c`:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

/* Our fake isatty - always returns 1 */
int fake_isatty(int fd) {
    return 1;  // Always claim we have a TTY
}

/* macOS DYLD_INTERPOSE magic */
typedef struct interpose_s {
    void *new_func;
    void *orig_func;
} interpose_t;

__attribute__((used)) static const interpose_t interposers[]
    __attribute__((section("__DATA, __interpose"))) = {
        { (void *)fake_isatty, (void *)isatty },
};
```

The `__DATA,__interpose` section tells the dynamic linker to replace all calls to `isatty` with `fake_isatty`.

### Going Further: Faking Terminal Capabilities

But ncurses doesn't just check `isatty()`. It also queries terminal attributes:

```c
int tcgetattr(int fd, struct termios *termios_p) {
    if (!termios_p) return -1;

    memset(termios_p, 0, sizeof(struct termios));

    /* Provide sane defaults for VT100-compatible terminal */
    termios_p->c_iflag = ICRNL | IXON;
    termios_p->c_oflag = OPOST | ONLCR;
    termios_p->c_cflag = CS8 | CREAD | CLOCAL;
    termios_p->c_lflag = ISIG | ICANON | ECHO;

    /* Control characters */
    termios_p->c_cc[VINTR] = 3;   // ^C
    termios_p->c_cc[VERASE] = 127; // DEL
    // ... etc

    return 0;
}

int tcsetattr(int fd, int optional_actions,
              const struct termios *termios_p) {
    return 0;  // Accept and ignore
}
```

And window size:

```c
int ioctl(int fd, unsigned long request, ...) {
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, request);

    if (request == TIOCGWINSZ) {
        struct winsize *ws = va_arg(args, struct winsize*);
        if (ws) {
            ws->ws_row = 24;
            ws->ws_col = 80;
            va_end(args);
            return 0;
        }
    }

    va_end(args);
    return 0;
}
```

### Compile and Test

```bash
# Build the shim
gcc -shared -fPIC -o faketty.dylib faketty.c

# Test it
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=./faketty.dylib TERM=xterm-256color \
  cargo test --lib curses:: -- --test-threads=1
```

## The Results

### Before (with `script`):
```
✅ Tests run: 3/3 passing
❌ Coverage: 18.56% (tests don't contribute)
```

### After (with `faketty.dylib`):
```
✅ Tests run: 3/3 passing
✅ Coverage: Measurable! (no process boundary)
✅ ncurses initialized successfully
✅ ACS codes work (0x78, 0x71)
```

**Test output:**
```
running 3 tests
ACS_VLINE: 0x78
ACS_HLINE: 0x71
test curses::tests::test_get_acs_codes ... ok
test curses::tests::test_get_acs_caps ... ok
test curses::tests::test_init_curses ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed
```

**No SKIP messages!** All tests run in the same process as llvm-cov!

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why DYLD_INTERPOSE Works

The `__DATA,__interpose` section is processed by dyld (the macOS dynamic linker) at load time:

1. dyld reads the interpose table
2. For each entry `(new_func, orig_func)`, it patches the dynamic symbol table
3. All calls to `orig_func` are redirected to `new_func`
4. This happens **before** any user code runs

Crucially, this works **within the same process**, so:
- llvm-cov instrumentation stays intact
- Coverage counters work normally
- No profiling data is lost to child processes

### Limitations

**macOS Only:**
- Linux would use `LD_PRELOAD` with a similar approach
- Windows would need DLL injection or import table patching

**System Integrity Protection (SIP):**
- May not work on SIP-protected binaries
- Development/testing binaries are fine

**Serial Execution Required:**
- ncurses is a global singleton
- Must use `--test-threads=1`

**Symbol Conflicts:**
- We saw some Perl plugin test failures (symbol interaction?)
- Needs more investigation for production use

## Lessons Learned

1. **The simple solution is often best**: We considered building a custom `script` replacement with IPC channels for profiling data. Overkill. Function interposition solved it in 90 lines of C.

2. **Platform differences matter**: `LD_PRELOAD` vs `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` vs `DYLD_INTERPOSE` – know your platform.

3. **"It's 2025, surely..."**: Yes! We CAN emulate a TTY for testing! The tools have been here all along.

4. **Test coverage drives quality**: Those 3 skipped tests were hiding potential bugs in our ncurses FFI code.

```bash
# Clone and try it
git clone https://github.com/selberhad/okros.git
cd okros
gcc -shared -fPIC -o tools/faketty.dylib tools/faketty.c

# Run TTY tests (they won't skip!)
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=./tools/faketty.dylib TERM=xterm-256color \
  cargo test --lib curses:: -- --test-threads=1
```

## Conclusion

Sometimes the best solutions come from idle thoughts during breaks. What started as "could we build a custom `script`?" ended as "just override three functions with DYLD_INTERPOSE."

**The moral?** When faced with "this can't be tested," ask: "Why not?" Often, the answer is simpler than you think.

And yes, in 2025, you absolutely CAN emulate a TTY for testing. Here's proof.
